/* Michael Long CS121
    Programming Assignment #3
    This program will pick a random # betweenn 1-100
    The user then will guess the number up to 20 times
    the program will determine how close or not close
    the number is to the random number and then help 
    the user as needed to get the answer. If the answer 
    is not obtained then the player loses and can choose 
    whether or not to play again.
